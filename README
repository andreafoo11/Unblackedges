SECTION B: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We got help from the office hours TAs Ann Marie, Imogen Eads, Jopsh, Alexander,
James, Andreas, and Grant.

SECTION C: PROGRAM PURPOSE
The purpose of this homework was to create two interfaces and
implementations of UArray2 and Bit2, using Hanson's UArray and Bit
interfaces. UArray2 and Bit2 are essentially the 2D array version.
Another purpose was to create a working program (Sudoku and Unblackedges)
that use the interfaces that we have created. Sudoku uses UArray2 interface
and checks if the given protable gray map is a sudoku solution or
not. As for Unblackedges, the program removes any black edge pixels
from the given portable bit map.

SECTION D: Aspects that have been implemented correctly
    UArray2.h/UArray2.c
        - Successfully creates a 2D unboxed array using Hanson's
        UArray structure. Contains functions such as create, free,
        and map a function over 2D array.

    Bit2.h/Bit2.c
        - Successfully creates a 2D bit array using Hanson's
        bit structure. Contains functions such as create, get,
        put, and map a function over 2D bit array.

    sudoku.c:
        - Given a pgm file with sudoku solution over it, the
        program successfuly checks if the solution is correct
        by checking each row, column, and 3x3 box for repeating
        numbers.

    unblackedges.c:
        - Given a pbm file containing an image made of black
        and white pixels, this program removes the black edges
        and convert them to white pixels.

    Number of hours worked on the homework: 25 hours
